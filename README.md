# Image Captioning using CNN+LSTM for SC4001

## Description
Our project is motivated by the fundamental human desire to make sense of the world through the lens of language. Images help to convey a vast amount of information immediately. However, this visual information is not readily accessible to everyone. For instance, visually impaired individuals rely heavily on descriptions to interpret images, while industries such as surveillance, seek to automate the tedious task of annotating vast quantities of visual data. Hence, our project showcases usefulness to various aspects of society.

## Installation
Image dataset is too large to be uploaded into GitHub.
1. Obtain the image dataset from Kaggle: [Flickr Image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k). _Last accessed: 9/11/2023._
2. Place the image folder inside flickr8k_images folder
